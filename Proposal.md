# **Scripting for Biologist Final Project Proposal**

For my final project I would like to run an analysis on heat shock protein gene expression data in python.
The experiment I am about to start will be looking at heat shock protein gene expression as one of many variables being assesed.
Where I will not have that data by the end of this semester my goal was to use a practice data set to complete this assignment.
The experiment my analysis is based on is looking at the affects of multiple heat wave exposures (40 degrees Celcius for 6-hr a day for 7 days) on physiological and epigenetic responses in zebra finches.


# Steps for my project:
1. Load the data into a dataframe.
2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each gene.
3. Create a heatmap of the gene expression values.
4. Identify the genes with the highest expression values.
5. Plot a bar chart of the top 3 genes by expression value.
6. Perform a principal component analysis to identify patterns in the data.
7. Perform a t-test to compare the expression levels between my 2 treatment groups.
